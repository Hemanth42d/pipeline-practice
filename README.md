# Build a Pipeline in jenkins.

In this repo I learned how to build a pipeline in jenkins in a google clouds VM instance and will be given a walkthrough how you guys can build the basic pipeline in jenkins.

The thing we need to check before building a pipeline is:
- We need a server to run these services on (In my example i am using a Google clouds virtual machine )
- Install docker in it as i run the jenkins services as a docker container
- Then Follow the procedure in ui to build it as shown below.

Basically building a pipeline is not done in ui which is in the case of freestyle job (Most of freestyle job can be done using UI)

## Install docker in server and run the jenkins as a docker container.

I have explained the way to do it in one of my repo and giving a link here go and check it out if you were not aware of running jenkins as a docker service.
